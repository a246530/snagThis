### Simple screen capture utility written in c#
Take a screen shot and have it save to a default folder, a location of your choosing, or just copy it to the clipboard so you can paste it later. That simple.

### How to use
Open application and a small box with a camera in it will appear in the left upper corner of your screen. The background will be red until you initiate taking a screenshot by clicking on the icon.

After you click the icon, it will turn green.

The next click you make will be the one that takes the screenshot. Click on the window you want a screenshot of and wait a second. This window will come up once the screenshot is complete.
